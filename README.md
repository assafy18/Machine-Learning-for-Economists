# Machine Learning Extension for Economic Paper
This repository presents my final project for the course Machine Learning for Economists (The Hebrew University of Jerusalem).

In this final project, I replicate the key findings from the paper *Vouchers for Private Schooling in Colombia: Evidence from a Randomized Natural Experiment* by by Joshua Angrist, Eric Bettinger, Erik Bloom, Elizabeth King, and Michael Kremer, published in the American Economic Review in 2002. The paper concludes that a voucher program, which partially covered the cost of private secondary school for students who maintained satisfactory academic progress, improved both educational and non-educational outcomes. The authors also tested the heterogeneity of the effect along the gender dimension (i.e., boys vs. girls) and found larger effects for girls in some outcomes.

The main contribution of my project is the extension of the heterogeneity analysis by exploring high-dimensional heterogeneous effects using an Honest Causal Tree analysis. In particular, I focus on examining the heterogeneous effects of the voucher program on outcomes such as grade repetition and test scores. This analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of how the voucher program impacted different subgroups of students and to highlight any nuanced variations in its effects across a variety of student characteristics.
