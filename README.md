# Machine-Learning-for-Economists
This repository presents my final project for the course Machine Learning for Economists (HUJI).

In this final project, I replicate the key findings from the paper *Vouchers for Private Schooling in Colombia: Evidence from a Randomized Natural Experiment* by by Joshua Angrist, Eric Bettinger, Erik Bloom, Elizabeth King, and Michael Kremer, published in the American Economic Review in 2002. The paper concludes that a voucher program, which partially covered the cost of private secondary school for students who maintained satisfactory academic progress, improved both educational and non-educational outcomes. The authors also tested the heterogeneity of the effect along the gender dimension (i.e., boys vs. girls) and found larger effects for girls in some outcomes.

In this project, I replicate the main results of the paper and extend the heterogeneity analysis by exploring high-dimensional heterogeneous effects using Honest Causal Tree analysis, as covered in the course.  Specifically, I explore the heterogeneous effects on grade repetition and test scores.
